User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Introduction:

Welcome to the artist, Amir´s website. He wanted a website where he could showcase his work, and also be contacted for art exhibitions or 
to buy his art. 
The home page is very simple, and just contains a navbar, and the artists´s pen name,  It also contains some non-functioning tabs as decoration 
to show the themes the artist is interested in and uses as inspiration for his art. It also contains a footer, to threee social media platforms, 
that is not actually existent. 
On the about me page, is a picture of the artist himself, in a space suit. The other picture is his pen name signature along with his most sold
piece of art, "Humanoid". It also tell a bit about the artist, and where he draws his ideas and inspiration from. 
Then he has a gallery, where there are 9 pieces showcased. You have to click on the picture in order to see the full picture, seeing as they are 
all different sizes. I think that worked nicely. 
The contact page is very simple, but gives the user the opportunity to send a message to the artist, whether they would like to know about 
upcoming exhibitions or if the person is interested in buying any of the art. 
The font throughout the website is called Orbitron, which fits in very well with this space-theme. 

Technologies used:
Bootstrap is used for the bulk of the layout. 
The font is by google fonts.
The rocket on the button on the contact page is from Font Awesome. 
The backround pictures are taken from google images. 
The pictures in the galary are from the artist´ private collecion.

Testing:
Throughout this project I tested regularly. I saved and reloaded the page after every change I made. 
I showed the website to the artist who was happy with the outcoome,altough would like to make some changes to it. But for the 
purpose of my project, he was satisfied.
