# Amigeo Website - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

[View the live project here.](https://)

This is the website for AMIGEO. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for people interested in his art or for people to read about and contact the artist. He wanted a website where he could showcase his work, and also be contacted for art exhibitions or to buy his art.

A space inspired artist, using bold and beautiful colors inspired in turn by nebulas, now has a beautiful website that brings the space theme to centre focus, but without taking away from the art itself. The art images can be clicked on individually in order to view each on on a larger scale.

-   ### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME#user-stories)User stories
    
    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals
        
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want the user to feel like they have just entered space as soon as they go on the home page.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find the art images.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to find a way to learn more about the artist and easily contact the artist directly.
    -   #### Frequent Visitor Goals
        
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added works of art.
        2.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there is any news of exhibitions when the website has evolved.
   
-   ### Design
    
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        
        -   The main colours used are black, grey, yellow and blue with space inspired backgrounds.
    -   #### Typography
        
        -   The Orbitron font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Orbitron is from Google Fonts, and has a space-feeling to it, so it really works well with the theme of this website.
    -   #### Imagery
        
        -  This is an artists website, so images are the main reason for coming to this site. The space themed backgrounds are intended to be make you feel like you have arrived in space, which should catch the user's attention. It has clean lines, simple aesthetic. The images used on the website are all from google, and the art work images are from the artist himself.



-   ### Wireframes

    
    -   In my initial wireframe, I focused a bit more on using the art itself as background pictures, as well as using a frame on the home page. But
after some guidance from my Code mentor, the background was changed to match the space theme, as they fit in so much better with the themeof the art. It also does not collide with the art itself, nor does it distract from it, but enhances it.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals
    
      

1. As a First Time Visitor, I want the user to feel like they have just entered space as soon as they go on the home page.

	 1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice.

	2. The focal point of the page, contains the artists´s pen name, underneath which contains some non-functioning tabs as decoration to describe
the themes the artist is interested in and uses as inspiration for his art. The user has two options, click on the nav bar to go to another page,
or hover over the footer where three social media platforms are provided, to choose the one they want to go to.

2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find the art images.

	1. From the nav bar, gallery is the third option, Gallery. Once clicked, the user is taken to the art.

	2. Under Gallery are 9 pieces showcased.

	3. You can click on the picture in order to see the full picture.

  

3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to find a way to learn more about the artist and easily contact the artist directly.

	1. On the about me page, is a picture of the artist himself, in a space suit. The other picture is his pen name signature along with his most sold piece of art, “Humanoid”. It also tells a bit about the artist, and where he draws his ideas and inspiration from.

	2. The contact page is very simple, but gives the user the opportunity to send a message to the artist, whether they would like to know about upcoming exhibitions or if the person is interested in buying any of the art.
    

-   #### Frequent User Goals
    
    1.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added works of art. 
        
        1.  The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily find the gallery page again. 
    2.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if the website has evolved to include blog posts or news of upcoming exhibitions. 
        

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhoneS and Samsung Gallaxy. 
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site.



## Deployment

### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME#github-pages)GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages by following the steps on the Code Institute READme example and using the following steps...

1.  Log in to GitHub and locate the  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2.  At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    -   Alternatively Click  [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/)  for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3.  Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4.  Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5.  The page will automatically refresh.

### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME#forking-the-github-repository)Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1.  Log in to GitHub and locate the  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2.  At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3.  You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### [](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME#making-a-local-clone)Making a Local Clone
