User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Introduction:

Welcome to the artist, Amir´s website. He wanted a website where he could showcase his work, and also be contacted for art exhibitions or
to buy his art.
A space inspired artist, using bold and beautiful colors inpired in turn by nebulas, now has a beautiful website that brings the space theme to
centre focus, but without taking away from the art itself. The art images can be clicked on indivually in order to view each on on a larger scale.

UX Design
I want the user to feel like they have just entered space as soon as they go on the home page.
Whenever Amir meets someone, especially if they are interested in art, he likes to show them pictures of his work. This way, with this website, he will have the
possibility of not only showing off his work, but also giving the person he is showing it to, the possibilty of showing it to others,
just by remembering his name.
In my initial wireframe, I focused a bit more on using the art itself as background pictures, as well as using a frame on the home page. But
after some guidance from my Code mentor, I changed the background theme to pictures from space, as they fit in so much better with the theme
of the art. It also does not collide with the art itself, nor does it distract from it, but enhances it.
The images used on the website are all from google, and the art work images are from the artist himself.
The home page is very simple, and just contains a navbar, and the artists´s pen name, It also contains some non-functioning tabs as decoration
to show the themes the artist is interested in and uses as inspiration for his art. It also contains a footer, to threee social media platforms,
that is not actually existent.
On the about me page, is a picture of the artist himself, in a space suit. The other picture is his pen name signature along with his most sold
piece of art, “Humanoid”. It also tell a bit about the artist, and where he draws his ideas and inspiration from.
Then he has a gallery, where there are 9 pieces showcased. You have to click on the picture in order to see the full picture, seeing as they are
all different sizes. I think that worked nicely.
The contact page is very simple, but gives the user the opportunity to send a message to the artist, whether they would like to know about
upcoming exhibitions or if the person is interested in buying any of the art.
The font throughout the website is called Orbitron, which fits in very well with this space-theme.

Technologies used:
Bootstrap is used for the bulk of the layout.
The font is by google fonts.
The rocket on the button on the contact page is from Font Awesome.
The backround pictures are taken from google images.
The pictures in the galary are from the artist´ private collecion.

Deployment
The whole project is deployed to Github Pages.

Testing:
Throughout this project I tested regularly. I saved and reloaded the page after every change I made.
I showed the website to the artist who was happy with the outcoome,altough would like to make some changes to it. But for the
purpose of my project, he was satisfied.
